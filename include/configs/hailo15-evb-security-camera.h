/*! @note: lpddr4 inline ecc located at the top 1/8 of the referred CS.
 *         In regards of using LPDDR4 setup of:
 *           - 2 ranks (Also refered as CS)
 *           - 2 channels per rank
 *           - Each channel is 16 bits wide => each rank is 32 bits bide
 *           - Rank size: 2G bytes
 *         If __not__ using ECC, then memory access are located in a single region:
 *           - 0x80000000 -  0x17fffffff: Bank #0 (4G = 0x100000000)
 *         If using ECC, then memory region is spilted to 2 ranges:
 *           - 0x080000000 - 0x0efffffff: Bank #0     (1.75G = 0x70000000)
 *           - 0x0f0000000 - 0x0ffffffff: Bank #0 ECC (0.25G = 0x10000000)
